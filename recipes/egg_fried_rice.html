        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One Bowl of Rice</li>
            <li>Two Eggs</li>
            <li>3 Scallions</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the scallions into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs and separate the yolk from the white. Separating the yolk is to make it more visually appetizing. It also concentrates the yolk flavor.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg yolk into the bowl of rice.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper on the rice.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooking oil into the bowl of rice enough to cover all the rice on the surface and mix them.</li>
            <li>Cook the chopped scallions on low heat with cooking oil.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce to the scallions to give it a kinda burnt effect. But be careful not to overcook and burn it too much.</li>
            <li>Pour the rice from the bowl into the scallions. Turn the heat up to medium or high and mix them until it's done.</li>
        </ol>
